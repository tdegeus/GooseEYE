.. _theory_S2:

2-point probability
===================

Theory
------

This measure determines the typical distance over which two points (pixels, voxels, ...) are related to each other. This is best understood by considering a binary 2D image, wherein each pixel is either black or white. This is described by the following indicator function, indicating the 'greyscale' of a pixel at position :math:`\vec{x}_i`:

.. math::

  \mathcal{I}(\vec{x}_i)
  =
  \begin{cases}
    1 \quad & \mathrm{if}\;\; \vec{x}_i\; \in \mathrm{white} \\
    0 \quad & \mathrm{if}\;\; \vec{x}_i\; \in \mathrm{black} \\
  \end{cases}

The 2-point probability, :math:`S_2`, is the probability that two points, at a certain distance :math:`\Delta \vec{x}` are both white. I.e.

.. math::

  S_2 (\Delta \vec{x})
  =
  P
  \big\{
    \mathcal{I}( \vec{x}               ) = 1 ,
    \mathcal{I}( \vec{x}+\Delta\vec{x} ) = 1
  \big\}

Two limits can directly be identified. If the two points coincide, the probability that both points are white is the same as the probability that one point is white: the (volume) fraction of white, :math:`\varphi`. I.e.

.. math::

  S_2 ( || \Delta \vec{x} || = 0) = \varphi

If the two points are completely uncorrelated, when the points are far apart, each point has a probability :math:`\varphi` to be white, and thus

.. math::

  S_2 ( || \Delta \vec{x} || \rightarrow \infty) = \varphi^2

In between these extremes, :math:`S_2` decays from :math:`\varphi` towards the asymptotic value of :math:`\varphi^2`.

Example
-------

This example is based on a simple, periodic, image comprising circular white inclusions embedded in a black background. The figure shows from left to right: the image, the 2-point probability :math:`S_2` in two dimensions, and a cross-section of this result in the middle of the region-of-interest along the horizontal axis.

.. note::

    The Python-code can be used for the plotting: The complete code is included in the download. Note that to obtain the same plot one should download and install the matplotlib-styles available in `GooseMPL <https://www.github.com/tdegeus/GooseMPL>`_.

.. note::

  All functions make the assumption of the images being periodic. If this assumption is not reasonable be sure to specify the `periodic` option (that defaults True).

.. _theory_S2_masked:

Masked correlation
------------------

This function (as most of GooseEYE's functions) also has the possibility to mask certain pixels. The image's mask is a binary matrix of exactly the same shape as the image. For each pixel in the mask with value ``1``, the corresponding pixel in the image is ignored. The normalisation is corrected for the reduced amount of data points, whereby the number of data points is no longer constant over the region-of-interest.

.. _theory_S2_ensemble:

Ensemble average
----------------

To compute the ensemble average of a statistic one constructs an ``Ensemble`` with a certain shape for the region-of-interest, and then adds the result per image to it. Consider the following example.

Auto-correlation
----------------

The the greyscale generalisation of the :ref:`theory_S2` (for floating-point images (with :math:`0 \leq \mathcal{I}(\vec{x}_i) \leq 1`) corresponds to:

.. math::

  S_2 ( \Delta \vec{x} )
  =
  \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \mathcal{I} ( \vec{x}_i ) \,
  \mathcal{I} ( \vec{x}_i + \Delta \vec{x} )
  \equiv \mathcal{I} ( \vec{x} ) \star \mathcal{I} ( \vec{x} )

Along the same arguments as for the :ref:`theory_S2`, limit values can be obtained. In this case:

.. math::

  S_2( \Delta \vec{x} = 0 )                &= \langle \mathcal{I}^2 \rangle   \\
  S_2( \Delta \vec{x} \rightarrow \infty ) &= \langle \mathcal{I}   \rangle^2

where the brackets :math:`\langle \ldots \rangle` denotes the spatial average.
