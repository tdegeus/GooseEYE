GooseEYE can be used from C++ or as a Python module. To start using either, please consider the theory and examples below that describe briefly the different measurements and their interpretation, accompanied by a C++ and a Python example. For questions beyond the examples the readers for either the C++ or the Python interface can be consulted. Since this is a research code, the code itself is the best reference. To two readers therefore mostly point to the code itself.
